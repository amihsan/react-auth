# Simple React app with User authentication

# Firebase Auth REST API

# How to use?
First you need to run 'npm install' to download all dependencies and then 'npm start' to open the development server.

# Important: 
If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).
